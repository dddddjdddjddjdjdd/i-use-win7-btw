Windows 7 Fan-Made Survival Guide

## Introduction

This is a list of applications, games, frameworks, updates, patches, etc. compatible with the Windows 7 operating system.

Software listed on this page can either be compatible with vanilla Windows 7 or it might require adding missing DLLs
or other patches, to either the mentioned software or the entire OS.

### Help! XYZ is missing, what can I do?

There's no way I can possibly list all software ever made - **but you can help!**

If you find something is missing - be it your favorite game, a web browser, or a magic solution to run all modern apps -
I'll be very happy to accept your contribution to this list.

Simply press **Edit file**, change what you need and press **Commit changes**. Then, create a pull request (PR) back
to this repository.

### What kind of software should I add?

Basically, everything that you're using daily. There are no strict rules - even software **incompatible** with Windows 7
can be added - who knows, maybe it will be patched one day.

That being said, this list is mostly for **maintained, still developed software**. So try not to add programs that
haven't been updated for the past 15 years.

I'm also interested in any Windows patches or modifications! If you ported some software from a different version of
Windows, feel free to add it to the list too.
